    <h1> the old paper</h1>
    <p>Before 1798, Nicholas-Louis Robert constructed the first pape
        r-making machine. Using a moving screen belt, paper was made one 
        sheet at a time by dipping a frame or mold with 
        a screen bottom into a vat of pulp. A few years later the brothers Hen
        ry and Sealy Fourdrinier improved Roberts machine, and in 1809 John Dickins
        on invented the first cylinder machine.
        Although almost all steps in papermaking have become highl
        y mechanized, the basic process has remained essentially unchanged. First, th
        e fibres are separated and wetted to produce the paper pulp, or stock. The pulp is t
        hen filtered on a woven screen to form a sheet of fibre, which is pressed and compacted to squeeze out most
         of the water. The remaining water is removed by evaporation, and the dry sheet is further compressed and,</p>
        <p>vegetable, or mineral source and convertible into nonwoven fabrics such as felt or paper or, after spinning into 
            yarns, into woven cloth. A natural fibre may
             be further defined as an agglomeration of cells
             in which the diameter is negligible in comparison with the length. Although nature abounds in fibrous materials, especia
             lly cellulosic types such as cotton, wood, grains, and straw, only a small num
             ber can be used for textile products or other industrial purposes. Apart from economic considerations, the usefulness of a fib
             re for commercial purposes is determined by such prope
             rties as length, strength, pliability, elasticity, abrasion resistance, absorbency, and various surface properties. Most textile 
             fibres are slender,
              flexible, and </p>
